This project explores a dataset of over 86,000 hotel bookings to identify patterns related to cancellations, guest profiles, and booking behavior. It was developed as part of my Data Science portfolio.

- Most bookings were for two adults staying 1–4 nights.
- Bed & breakfast is the most common meal plan across all guest group sizes.
