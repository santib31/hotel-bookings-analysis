# Hotel Booking Demand Analysis 🏨📊

This project explores a dataset of over 86,000 hotel bookings to identify patterns related to cancellations, guest profiles, and booking behavior. It was developed as part of my Data Science portfolio.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
- Cleaned and analyzed using Python in Google Colab.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Cancellation rates were high, especially in City Hotels and for short-duration stays.
- Portugal led in both the number of bookings and cancellations.
- Non-canceled bookings dropped consistently every year between November and February.
- Most bookings were for two adults staying 1–4 nights.
- Bed & breakfast is the most common meal plan across all guest group sizes.

## 🛠 Tools Used
